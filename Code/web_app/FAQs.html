          </label>
          <article class="ac-small">
            <p>Ans: This is a project based on Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning. It involves a benchmark data set as well as there will be some additional data which will be provided by us. From the combination of the dataset and using deep learning technology we would recognize which flower is it that will simply identify flowers.

          <label for="ac-2" >Q. What is the purpose of this project?
          </label>
          <article class="ac-medium">
            <p>Ans: With an advancement of deep learning classification task is becoming more and more challenging day by day. Some researches already been done regarding this topic but all of them are western based. The data sets that were used contained mostly the flowers that are found in the western countries. Therefore, it is very obvious that flowers like “Kodomful’’, “Krishnochura” couldn’t be identified. So, our aim will be to identify or classify not only the western flowers but also some Bangladeshi flowers with the help of a web application.

          <input id="ac-3" type="checkbox">
          <label for="ac-3" >Q. What is Deep Learning and why is it so popular these days?
          </label>
          <article class="ac-large">
            <p>Ans:  Deep Learning is nothing but a paradigm of machine learning which has shown incredible promise in the recent years. This is because of the fact that Deep Learning shows great analogy with the functioning of the human brain. The superiority of the human brain is an evident fact, and it is considered to be the most versatile and efficient self-learning model that has ever been created.
